Q1: Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread? Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing. Submit your sequence with a short explanation in answers-thread.txt

Answer:
table[0]: entry(0, 0)

thread 0 trys to insert (5,0)
entry(5,0)->entry(0,0)

thread 1 trys to insert (10,1)
entry(10,1)->entry(0,0)

Then entry(5,0) is missing.
